  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {SignificanceAccurate intraoperative assessment of intestinal tissue viability is critical in determining the extent of resection in cases of intestinal ischemia. Current evaluation methods are largely subjective and lack the precision required for reliable decision-making during surgery.AimWe aim to develop and validate a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system combined with machine learning (ML) to objectively assess intestinal wall viability and differentiate between reversible and irreversible ischemia.ApproachA portable HSI system was used to acquire spectral data from rat models with induced intestinal ischemia at different time points (1, 6, and 12 h). Tissue oxygen saturation was calculated using a two-wavelength algorithm. Spectral data were classified using an ML pipeline based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the XGBoost algorithm, trained on histologically validated tissue classes.ResultsTissue saturation decreased with prolonged ischemia (from 66% in healthy tissue to 21% after 12 h). Classification accuracy using PCA features reached 98% for intact tissue, 95% for possibly reversible ischemia, and 97% for irreversible ischemia. Classification maps closely matched tissue saturation distributions and histological findings. Initial clinical testing confirmed the system’s sensitivity to ischemic changes in human subjects, although further training on human data is required for ML application.ConclusionsHSI combined with ML provides an effective, non-invasive tool for real-time intraoperative assessment of intestinal viability. This approach improves the objectivity of surgical decision-making and may reduce unnecessary resections.},
