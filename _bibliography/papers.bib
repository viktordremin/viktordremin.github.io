abstract = {SignificanceAccurate intraoperative assessment of intestinal tissue viability is critical in determining the extent of resection in cases of intestinal ischemia. Current evaluation methods are largely subjective and lack the precision required for reliable decision-making during surgery.AimWe aim to develop and validate a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system combined with machine learning (ML) to objectively assess intestinal wall viability and differentiate between reversible and irreversible ischemia.ApproachA portable HSI system was used to acquire spectral data from rat models with induced intestinal ischemia at different time points (1, 6, and 12 h). Tissue oxygen saturation was calculated using a two-wavelength algorithm. Spectral data were classified using an ML pipeline based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the XGBoost algorithm, trained on histologically validated tissue classes.ResultsTissue saturation decreased with prolonged ischemia (from 66% in healthy tissue to 21% after 12 h). Classification accuracy using PCA features reached 98% for intact tissue, 95% for possibly reversible ischemia, and 97% for irreversible ischemia. Classification maps closely matched tissue saturation distributions and histological findings. Initial clinical testing confirmed the system’s sensitivity to ischemic changes in human subjects, although further training on human data is required for ML application.ConclusionsHSI combined with ML provides an effective, non-invasive tool for real-time intraoperative assessment of intestinal viability. This approach improves the objectivity of surgical decision-making and may reduce unnecessary resections.},

    abstract = {We present an intraoperative hyperspectral imaging (HSI) approach for the assessment of intestinal ischemia, integrating deep learning-based segmentation with unsupervised spectral clustering. Sixteen patients were enrolled, of whom hyperspectral datasets from three representative cases were analyzed in detail. The developed convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) demonstrated high classification performance between intestinal tissue and background, enabling consistent delineation of clinically relevant regions. For ischemia assessment, oxygen saturation was estimated using a two-wavelength method, and principal component analysis combined with Gaussian mixture modeling (PCA-GMM) was applied to spectral features. The clustering revealed progressive separation of intact, moderately ischemic, and severely ischemic tissue, consistent with intraoperative surgical observations. This pipeline enables pixel-wise visualization of ischemic alterations with quantitative metrics, providing surgeons with objective and spatially resolved information to support resection decisions. The proposed framework demonstrates feasibility in clinical practice and establishes a foundation for large-scale validation and integration into intraoperative decision-support systems.},

  abstract = {Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) is a modern, non-invasive technique for assessing microvascular perfusion in humans and laboratory animals. The combination of LSCI with invasive blood pressure (BP) measurement and a vascular occlusion test allows the study of postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH), providing an assessment of microvascular blood flow reserve and the vascular reactivity. This article demonstrates the technique of using the LSCI to record and visualize PORH in the hind paw of a rat under general anesthesia. A special pneumatic cuff is inflated to create a temporary (180 s) vascular occlusion at the level of the tibia. Evaluation of the subsequent PORH (peak hyperemia and kinetic indices) can provide additional information on the mechanisms and severity of the pathological process under study (circulatory shock, heart failure, hypertension, etc.) or identify vascular effects of a new drug that are not apparent when assessing perfusion at rest. Invasive BP monitoring allows calculation of cutaneous vascular conductance and consideration of changes in systemic hemodynamics, which is particularly important in experimental models of critical illness. The use of this approach to identify microvascular dysfunction in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock will also be demonstrated.},

Optical percutaneous needle biopsy is a promising method for increasing the diagnostic efficiency of the procedure by selecting the area for sample extraction and obtaining information about vascular changes and the metabolism of biological tissues at the needle tip. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing technical solutions to address various diagnostic tasks: studying the metabolic status of tissues for the adjustment of treatment protocols, differentiating healthy and tumour tissues for navigating puncture needles, and obtaining preliminary diagnoses of the nature of neoplasms. Technical systems for assessing the perfusion and metabolic characteristics of biological tissues using fine-needle probes have been described. Fine-needle probe designs for biopsies of various organs are also presented. The results of using optical percutaneous needle biopsy in liver and breast cancers are demonstrated.},

abstract = {β-Amyloid is the peptide which forms extracellular senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Link of the β-amyloid to inherited form of Alzheimer's disease and neurotoxicity of aggregated peptide has been suggested to the involvement of β-amyloid in the mechanism of pathology of this devastating disease. The toxicity of aggregated β-amyloid is triggered by changes in calcium signal, mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Laser (1267 nm)-induced singlet oxygen is shown to be able to modify proteins and accelerate energy metabolism that potentially may modify the effects of β-amyloid. Using primary co-culture of neurons and astrocytes we studied the effect of laser-generated singlet oxygen on β-amyloid-induced calcium signal, mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative stress. We have found that singlet oxygen prevents aggregation of the full peptide βA 1–42, reduces the effect of β-amyloid on cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium elevation, reduces mitochondrial depolarization and depletion of NADH in mitochondria. As result it protected neurons and astrocytes against β-amyloid-induced cell death. Thus, singlet oxygen could play neuroprotective role.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
